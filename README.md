Lightning

Various types of available lighting:

Fluorescent lighting: Fluorescent lighting is now widely used for applications using automated optical inspection machine as it provides an effective form of illumination for fault display on printed circuit boards. The main problem with fluorescent lamps for AOI applications is that they decompose over time. This means that the automated optical inspection system will be subject to changes in light levels and quality.

LED Lighting: LED lighting production has allowed AOIâ€™s automated optical control systems to adopt a more stable form of lighting. Although light-emitting diode illumination over time causes a reduction in light output, this increase can be compensated by an increase in current. Through the use of LED lighting, you can also control the level of lighting. LEDs therefore have much more satisfactory lighting than fluorescent or incandescent lamps used in the past.

Infrared or Ultraviolet: In some situations, it is possible that infrared lamps or ultraviolet may be needed to improve certain defects or to allow automatic optical control to detect certain types of defects.

In addition to the form of lighting, it is also important to position the lighting for an automatic optical control system, AOI. Light sources should be positioned not only so that all areas are well lit, which is especially important when some components can cast shadows, but also expose faults. For different devices, careful adjustment may be required.


High quality illumination of the component or area to be inspected is essential for AOI.
Obviously, the AOI system must be able to see the parts and features to be able to perform
the inspection. In addition, color lighting is very effective in eliminating background image
noise.
Early AOI systems used incandescent, fluorescent, infrared (IR), or ultraviolet (UV) lighting.
Currently, almost all AOI systems used for PCBA inspection use LEDs (light-emitting diodes)
as the light source. TRI's lighting system includes white, red, green, and blue (RGB-W) LEDs
in a configurable lighting module.
The angle of the lighting is also important. Taller components on a PCBA can block the light
from reaching shorter components, while some features require very low angle illumination to
be visible. It is important for AOI systems to have light sources from different angles to offer
the best overall illumination.
The figure below illustrates how different lighting configurations affect visibility of different
features. Choosing the correct light setup to inspect each feature can strongly influence
inspection accuracy.
